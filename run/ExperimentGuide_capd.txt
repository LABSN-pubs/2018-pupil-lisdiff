# EXPERIMENT NAME
capd

# RUN SCRIPT

# SCRIPT PROMPTS
participant: consecutively numbered
session: 0-7, should be randomly assigned within each participant pool (CAPD, control)
         such that all 8 sessions are used up before a given session is repeated.

# EXPERIMENT TYPE/EQUIPMENT
pupillometry

# APPROXIMATE RUN TIME
50 min task + variable training (10-30 minutes) = 60-80 minutes

# LIGHTS ON/OFF?
off
 
# CODE
larsoner/capd/capd.py (run from Spyder via F5)

# TASK
Attend to one of two simultaneous co-located talkers, pressing a button as quickly
as possible following each occurrence of the letter "O" in the target stream.
Talkers are male-female, MM, or FF, and can be co-located (both L or both R) or
spatially separated (one L one R).

# STIMULI
Streams of four letters from each talker, preceded by AA (maintain attn) or AU
(switch attn). Initial target (M/F) and initial location (L/R) are constant within
a given block.

# EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS/DATA ORGANIZATION
Pupil data and behavioral data both go in ./data, MEG data to acquisition machine.
